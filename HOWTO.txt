ZgeSkelet Library - How to Compile
==================================

Note: By <homedir> is meant the directory where the ZgeSkelet sources are extracted on your computer.

Before compiling the ZgeSkelet, you must checkout the Cal3D sources to <homedir>\cal3d directory. The Cal3D sources can be obtained from Subversion repository: svn://svn.gna.org/svn/cal3d/trunk/cal3d


Compilation of ZgeSkelet to Windows DLL with MSVC
-------------------------------------------------

The ZgeSkelet DLL can be compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 (MSVC) or higher.

1. Modify the Cal3D library: open (convert from previous version) the MSVC solution file \cal3d\cal3d.sln and change the following properties of the cal3d project:

 - General / Configuration Type to StaticLibrary
 - C/C++ / Code Generation / Runtime Library to Multi-threaded (/MT)

2. Build the cal3d project with the Release configuration. The result will be placed to the <homedir>\cal3d\bin\Release\cal3d.lib file.

3. Open <homedir>\vs2010\ZgeSkelet.sln or ZgeSkelet.vcxproj in MSVC.

4. Set directories and library dependencies: ZgeSkelet requires an OpenGL library, so you need to include the path to the local header files to the C/C++ / General / Additional Include Directories. For instance, glew-1.10.0\include, if you use GLEW.

5. Build the ZgeSkelet project resulting in <homedir>\lib\ZgeSkelet.dll file.


Compilation of ZgeSkelet to Windows DLL with Code::Blocks
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Open the <homedir>\cb]\ZgeSkelet.workspace.

2. Build the Cal3D project. The resulting library is placed to <homedir>cal3d\bin\Release\libcal3d.a file.

3. Build the ZgeSkelet project resulting in <homedir>\lib\ZgeSkelet.dll file.


Compilation of ZgeSkelet to Android Shared Library
--------------------------------------------------

The ZgeSkelet shared library (.so) is compiled with Android NDK which must be installed on your computer; see http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/ for details.

1. Move to the <homedir>/android/ folder.

2. Run the ndk-build command of the Android NDK. The result are placed to the <homedir>/android/libs/<architecture>/libZgeSkelet.so files.
